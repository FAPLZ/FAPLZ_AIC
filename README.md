Here you can download AIV (Artificial Intelligence Village) and AIC (Artificial Intelligence Character) files for the game: Stronghold Crusader.

There are 8 AIV's for every AI character, specially created for the AIC file.

IMPORTANT: The AIC file should not work with most of the Vanilla AIV files, because there are too less population/houses to manage the whole economy.

AIV files who work, are listed below:

-A

-B

-C
